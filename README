# Solar-System

**A university group project simulating gravitational interactions and orbital dynamics of celestial bodies in the Solar System.**

Original repository: [Sollaris](https://github.com/pkakol00/Sollaris)

## Overview

The **Solar-System** project is a simulation tool designed to visualize the gravitational movements of celestial bodies such as planets and moons. It leverages physics-based modeling to realistically represent orbital mechanics within our Solar System.

This project was developed as part of a university course, with contributions from multiple team members. It features real-time data integration and accurate positional rendering of planetary bodies.

## Features

- Physics-based gravity simulation  
- Real-time visualization of planetary motion  
- Integration with NASAâ€™s **Horizons** API for current celestial body positions
